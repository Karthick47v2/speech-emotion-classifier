This is a part of [Mock-Buddy](https://github.com/Karthick47v2/mock-buddy) project, used to detect speech confidence. CNN architecture used to build the model to classify emotions. The ensembled model is build with TensorFlow applying bootstrap aggregation apporach.

## Prerequisite

- Python 3.7 or newer

## Dataset

- [RAVDEES](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio)
- [SAVEES](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/surrey-audiovisual-expressed-emotion-savee)
- [TESS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess)

## Usage

- You can download dataset from `data.ipynb`. Run it and preprocess data.
- Run `train.ipynb` to start training.
- `ser_pred.ipyb` has template for using model inside other applications.
